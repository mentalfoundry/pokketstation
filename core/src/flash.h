 * +0xC  F_WAIT1 (waitstates).
 * +0x10 F_WAIT2 (waitstates, and flash-write control and status).
 *
 * A corrected fault: a real BIOS flash-write routine reads +0x10 and
 * waits for bit 2 to read back as set. This emulator did not model that
 * register before the correction; the span stopped at +0xC. An unmapped
 * read returned 0, thus the poll loop continued for an unlimited time.
 * This was the second of two busy-wait faults that stopped each real app
 * launch. The first fault was in the +0 command readback of
 * flash_ctrl_read8. See the comment on that function.
 * This emulator does not model real flash write timing, thus writes
 * complete immediately. Because of this, +0x10 always reads back as
 * "not busy".
 *
 * The span continues to 0x140, to also cover F_BANK_VAL (+0x100 to
 * +0x13C, 16 words). F_BANK_FLG shows which physical 8KB blocks are
 * enabled. F_BANK_VAL maps each physical block to a virtual bank slot
 * (0-15): table[physical] = virtual. This is the opposite direction from
 * a usual page table. An earlier version of this file used a linear
 * offset in place of the table. That assumption was incorrect. The range
 * between +0x14 and +0xFF is unmapped. Reads in this range give the
 * last_command mirror default.

 * SWI 0Fh FlashWriteSerial read and write). It also holds F_CAL (the LCD
 * calibration). Real hardware writes F_CAL again together with F_SN at
 * each FlashWriteSerial call. The span continues from 0x140 to 0x400 to
 * cover F_EXTRA. See flash_ctrl_read8 and flash_ctrl_write8 for the
 * reason that the range between the two regions (0x140-0x2FF, unmapped
 * and unidentified) reads back as 0, and does not use the F_BANK_VAL

/* The default hardware ID (F_SN).
 *
 * The companion app of one PS1 game reads the serial number of the
 * PocketStation with SWI 0Ah, when the player makes a new save. A
 * disassembly of a real copy of that app confirms this (see
 * docs/hardware-notes.md, "Hardware ID (F_SN)"). The app masks F_SN down
 * to its low 24 bits. It converts that value to a string of decimal
 * digits, and uses the last 3 digits as the initial "ID" statistic of
 * the save. This ID statistic alone sets the rank. Public research gives
 * ID 211 as the best rank: the maximum HP and weapon value, and the best
 * item-drop probability. 211 is also the day and the month of the
 * Japanese release of that game (2/11).
 *
 * The mask removes the high byte of F_SN before this calculation, thus
 * the high byte has no effect on the rank. On some real units, the high
 * byte holds an ASCII letter. That letter is part of a serial sticker
 * that has one letter and 8 decimal digits, for example "A02374684". The
 * raw register has no such structural requirement (see
 * psemu_parse_hardware_id and psemu_format_hardware_id in
 * core/src/psemu.c).
 *
 * This emulator sets a default F_SN of 0x410000D3. The hex string form
 * of this emulator gives this value as "410000D3". The low 24 bits end
 * in "211", thus each new save from that app gets the best rank by
 * default. The high byte is an arbitrary letter, 'A'. It makes the value
 * look like a real serial number.
