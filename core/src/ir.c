/* This constant is a deliberate concession. It is not a model of a physical effect. This comment records
   it and does not conceal it.
   The receive-side sync-pulse acceptance window of a real IR app rejects the transmitted sync pulse of
   this emulator by a small margin. The measurement gives 26 to 38 Timer2 ticks less than the floor of
   the window. See "The transmitted falling edge is stretched" in docs/hardware-notes.md.
   Measurements on real hardware, at three separate times, removed each CPU explanation and each
   interrupt-dispatch explanation for a shortfall of this shape. Those measurements covered the timer
   reload behavior, the interrupt entry cost, and the re-arm latency, on both IRQ and FIQ. They included
   a full realistic dispatch chain with the same shape as the real transmit handler. All three agreed
   with real hardware exactly. Thus the digital timing of this emulator is not the cause of the gap.
   The best remaining explanation is the physics of a real transceiver, outside the CPU: an LED does not
   switch off immediately, and the response of a receiving photodiode and its AGC settling add real time
   before a pulse reads as complete. This emulator does not model IR as an analog signal, and this
   constant does not try to model it. The constant only delays the apparent end of a transmitted pulse,
   by a fixed quantity. Thus this fully digital link can satisfy the receive-side timing that a real app
   expects. That app was tuned against real analog hardware, which this project cannot reproduce.
   Only the falling edge is delayed: the point where software commands the LED off. The rising edge, where
   the LED comes on, stays at its true digital time. The OFF gap between pulses is not stretched. There
   is no real-hardware evidence for the receiver requirements in that gap. There is evidence only for the
   ON-pulse acceptance window.
   The tuning of this constant uses the measured shortfall of this emulator: 38 Timer2 ticks, at the
   IR-screen clock rate of a real app and the /2 divisor of Timer2. This code converts that value to the
   fixed PSEMU_ASSUMED_CPU_HZ reference rate. The tuning does not use the unrelated "184" constant of the
   real app. An earlier attempt used 184 directly and changed the order of the edges: it delayed a falling
   edge past the rising edge of the next pulse. The real gap between transmitted pulses is much less than
   184 Timer2 ticks. See tools/ir_probe.c for the two-instance test that calibrated this constant, and for
   the trace that found that incorrect order before release.
   A second, related failure has the same cause, at a smaller scale. A stretch of the falling edge must
   compress the OFF gap after it. There is no method to make an ON pulse longer without a reduction of an
   adjacent interval. At a value of 316, that compression left a margin of only approximately 1.2 to 1.6
   times IR_BFLT_DEBOUNCE_CYCLES on the shortest real gaps. That margin is too small: the glitch filter of
   this emulator sometimes rejected a real gap as noise. It then combined two pulses, and the bits that
   they encoded, into one pulse. The byte-for-byte buffer comparison in tools/ir_probe.c found this
   directly: specific bytes decoded incorrectly, and the raw Timer2-tick differences at those positions
   did not agree with any single-pulse duration. They agreed only with sums of two or three sequential
   pulses. A value of 200 keeps the sync pulse in its acceptance window with a good margin (4268 against a
   window of 4200 to 5400). It also keeps more than 3 times the debounce margin on the shortest gap.

   This code also limits the stretch to the ON duration of the pulse (see enqueue_tx_edge). The text above
   describes the tuning against one app whose pulses are wide envelopes. For that app, 200 cycles is a
   small correction. It is not a small correction for each app. One trading-card app transmits pulses of
   approximately 7 cycles (6.6us), with a space of 205 or 406 cycles between them. It encodes each bit in
   the length of the gap, and not in the pulse. A flat value of 200 inverted the waveform for that app. A
   measurement over a real transfer showed that a 7-cycle ON and 205-cycle OFF pattern arrived as a
   207-cycle ON and 5-cycle OFF pattern. Also, 272 gaps became exactly 0 cycles: the falling edge arrived
   at the next rising edge, and combined two pulses into one continuous ON period. Only the order guard
   below prevented a reversal of the edges, and a gap of zero length is already unrecoverable.
   The limit at the ON duration keeps this correction a turn-off tail, and not fabricated signal. A tail
   that is longer than its pulse is not a tail. The AGC of a receiver also settles faster after less
   delivered energy, thus a short pulse gets a proportionally short stretch. The limit has no effect for
   the app that supplied the tuning. The sync pulse of that app is approximately 4068 cycles wide, thus
   min(200, 4068) is still 200. Its measured sync figure of 4268 against the 4200 to 5400 window does not
   change. */

/* A transmission is observable in two conditions: IFMODE selects transmit, and STDBY is clear.
   A write to IRDA_DATA outside those conditions still changes the register value, the same as on real
   hardware. It makes no edge, because the transmitter does not drive the LED.

   BGEN is not part of this test. This is a correction of an earlier model. BGEN selects whether the
   hardware divides the ON envelope of the LED into a 40kHz burst. It does not control whether the LED
   comes on. This emulator relays only that ON/OFF envelope, and it does not model the sub-carrier in the
   envelope (see the top comment of ir.h). Thus BGEN has nothing to gate here.

   Two real apps that operate correctly give the answer. They use different BGEN values, and they agree in
   each other respect:
     - One app transmits with IRDA_MODE = 0x01: BGEN = 0 (the hardware carrier is on) and BFLT = 0 (the
       glitch filter is on). It sends wide envelope pulses, and the hardware fills them with the carrier.
     - A second app transmits with IRDA_MODE = 0x0D: BGEN = 1 (the hardware carrier is off) and BFLT = 1
       (the glitch filter is off). It drives the LED directly, with pulses of approximately 7 cycles
       (6.6us), and a space of 205 or 406 cycles between them. This is pulse-distance modulation, where
       the gap holds the bit. Those pulses are much shorter than IR_BFLT_DEBOUNCE_CYCLES. This is why the
       app turns the glitch filter off in the same write.
   Both apps transfer data on real hardware. A gate on BGEN made the second app send nothing at all: this
   emulator discarded each IRDA_DATA write, and tools/ir_probe.c reported "edges relayed: A->B 0" against a
   save state on the transfer screen of that app. */
