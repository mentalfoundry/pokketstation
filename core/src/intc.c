           The STATUS_MASK bits (the buttons and the RTC) also latch into `status`, for a direct
           read.

           History: this code first put the STATUS_MASK bits only into `status`, and never into
           `hold`. A disassembly of the real BIOS confirmed that this was incorrect.
           The top-level IRQ handler of the BIOS tests `hold & enable & 0x200` (RTC).
           The periodic callback that the BIOS installs tests `hold & 1` (the Action button).
           Both tests reach real handlers: the RTC acknowledge, and the day-rollover data (see
           docs/hardware-notes.md). Those handlers never executed with the earlier status-only
           routing.
           With that routing, the buttons and the RTC could never deliver an interrupt. Code could
           see them only through a direct read of `status`. */

           The reasoning was that INT_INPUT ("Raw Interrupt Signal Levels") is different from
           INT_LATCH ("Interrupt Request Flags"), and that the real RTC handler acknowledges its own
           bit.

           A trace of real hardware showed that this reasoning was incorrect. The real button-action
           callback, at 0x04003784, never acknowledges bit 0. A permanent latch of `hold` after a
           button release caused the CPU to enter the IRQ handler again at almost each instruction
           after one press. One test measured 559034 re-entries in 20 million instructions. A real
           device that a person can use does not operate this way.

           The buttons clear `hold` at release, the same as `status`.
           Only the real RTC handler also sends an acknowledge.
           This has no effect either way, because an acknowledge already clears `hold` and
           `status`. */
