/* The real PocketStation interrupt controller and its sources.
   A disassembly of a real BIOS corrected this data independently. See docs/hardware-notes.md.

   Registers at 0x0A000000:
   - hold (+0x0): read-only to software. Real hardware treats a write here as invalid.
   - status (+0x4): also read-only.
   - enable (+0x8): a write ORs bits into the register.
   - mask (+0xC): a write ANDs the applicable bits out of enable.
   - acknowledge (+0x10): write-only. It clears the applicable bits from hold and from status.

   Each asserted source latches into HOLD. ENABLE gates HOLD, and HOLD then operates the IRQ line and
   the FIQ line of the CPU.
   Button presses and the RTC tick (the bits in INT_STATUS_MASK) also latch into STATUS.
   STATUS lets code read a source directly, with no effect on the interrupt-delivery state. The RTC
   wait-for-pulse loop is one example.

   History: the interrupt-routing logic of this codebase first put STATUS_MASK bits only into
   `status`, and never into `hold`. A disassembly of a real BIOS showed that this was incorrect.
   The top-level IRQ handler of the BIOS tests `hold & enable & 0x200` (RTC).
   The periodic callback that the BIOS installs tests `hold & 1` (the Action button).
   Both tests reach real handlers, and a trace confirms this. Those handlers could never execute with
   the earlier status-only routing.
   Real hardware asserts these sources into both registers. This emulator now does the same. */

/* The sources whose live signal level STATUS shows.
   The name of that register is INT_INPUT, "Raw Interrupt Signal Levels", at 0x0A000004.
   See docs/hardware-notes.md, "Buttons".
   The buttons (bits 0-4) and the RTC (bit 9) were confirmed first.
   INT_IRDA (bit 12) came later, from a disassembly of the IR receive handler of a real app.
   That handler acknowledges the interrupt. It then reads STATUS, isolates bit 12, and compares that
   live level against the level that it expects. It stops immediately if the two levels differ.
   While bit 12 was absent from this mask, STATUS bit 12 always read back as 0.
   Thus that comparison could never succeed, and no IR transfer could decode.
   See apply_rx_level in core/src/ir.c, and docs/hardware-notes.md, "IR / IR Link". */

/* The sources whose STATUS bit is a continuous signal level, and not a latched request.
   An acknowledge write does NOT clear these bits.
   A disassembly of the INT_IRDA handler of a real app confirms this behavior for IR.
   That handler acknowledges INT_IRDA. Only then does it read STATUS to sample the live line level.
   That order is correct only if an acknowledge does not change the level. If an acknowledge changes
   the level, the handler always reads the result of its own acknowledge, which is 0, in place of the
   real signal. This is what occurred before this mask was added.
   The buttons are in this mask for the same reason. docs/hardware-notes.md, "Buttons", gives that
   `status` follows the live button level for code that reads the register directly. An acknowledge
   cleared that level before. Thus a button that the user still held read back as released, until
   something pressed the button again.
   The confirmed real-hardware finding about buttons applies to HOLD, not to STATUS. HOLD is a
   momentary edge pulse for each press. intc_clear_hold_only and psemu_set_buttons do this, and
   test_button_hold_pulses_not_sustained tests it. That finding gives no data about STATUS, and this
   mask does not change it.
   A real app depends on the live level. pk_timing_bench holds Action to open its exit prompt, and
   counts 75000 sequential reads of STATUS to detect the hold. Only a level that continues after an
   acknowledge can accumulate that count. */

   A real BIOS callback uses `hold` to select the source to service.

   that the callback tests later in the same chain.
