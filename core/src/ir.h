/* IRDA_MODE (offset 0) bits, IRDA_DATA (offset 4) bit 0, and IRDA_MISC (offset 0xC):
     IRDA_MODE bit0 IFMODE  0 = Receive, 1 = Transmit
     IRDA_MODE bit1 STDBY   0 = Active, 1 = Stand-by
     IRDA_MODE bit2 BGEN    0 = Enable the 40KHz carrier generator, 1 = Disable
     IRDA_MODE bit3 BFLT    0 = Enable the filter, 1 = Disable
     IRDA_DATA bit0 LED     Transmit: 0 = LED off, 1 = LED on. Receive: the demodulated line,
                            active low (0 = carrier present, 1 = idle).
     IRDA_MISC              Unknown and reserved. See the code for this register in ir_write below.

   A disassembly of a real IR app is the source of the STDBY, BGEN, and BFLT names, and the behavior
   of that app confirms them. Secondary register maps for this range do not agree with each other on
   the function of MODE bits 1 to 3. Thus this project does not use those maps as evidence. The
   behavior of the real app is the confirmation.

   The receive function of IRDA_DATA bit 0 has no documentation. It is an inference of this project,
   and the first inference (1 = carrier present) was incorrect. A disassembly of the receive handler
   of a real IR app gives the polarity. The handler reads the live line from INTC STATUS bit 12. It
   compares the line against an expected level that it holds in its own state. It arms itself for
   level 0 before a carrier arrives. It then measures the sync burst as the interval that ends when
   the line returns to 1. Thus a carrier burst reads 0, and an idle line reads 1. Real IR
   demodulator receivers also operate this way: their output is active low. With the first polarity,
   the handler rejected the edge that starts a sync burst. It then locked onto the short gap between
   pulses, and never went past sync detection. With this polarity, the handler continues to bit
   accumulation and assembles a full message. Real hardware does not confirm this polarity directly,
   but the polarity is no longer only an assumption. rx_level stays in physical terms (1 = carrier
   present). The inversion occurs where software reads the value: in ir_read, and in the INT_IRDA
   level of apply_rx_level.

   No source gives numeric timing for this peripheral. There are no microsecond pulse widths, and no
   carrier-to-pulse ratio more exact than "a long pulse is usually two times a short pulse". No
   source gets near the 184-tick transmit-timing gap that the hardware tests of this project examine
   (see docs/hardware-notes.md, "IR / IR Link"). Only measurement on real hardware can answer that
   question.

   Real pulses are long or short ON periods, with short OFF gaps between them. A long pulse is
   approximately two times a short pulse. There is a physical reason for this shape: real IR
   receiver hardware adapts to ambient light, and a long steady signal can look like a new ambient
   level instead of data. A trace of the transmitted signal of a real app shows this alternating
   shape (see the transmit-side analysis in tools/ir_probe.c).
   The real RX-IRQ handler (INT_IRDA, see intc.h) measures the length of an incoming pulse. It reads
   the live counter of Timer 2 (reload 0xFFFFh) at the interrupt. This is the usual technique for
   this measurement.

   The real BIOS has no IR functions, except basic initialization and power-down. The disassembly of
   this project confirms this. A real app writes to IRDA_MODE and IRDA_DATA directly from its own
   code, with its own interrupt handler. It does not use a BIOS SWI. Thus this project does not have
   to look for a BIOS-level IR interface.

   This file models IR as an asynchronous edge relay between two instances that have independent
   clocks. Real IR hardware operates the same way: two separate devices, two separate oscillators,
   and an optical signal between them. The two devices share no clock.
   There is no lockstep timing assumption between a local core and the source of its RX edges. That
   source is a loopback caller, or a second emulator instance on some transport.
   The core tracks only its own local monotonic time. It reacts to edges that carry a timestamp on
   that local timeline.

   The core stays platform-agnostic. It knows nothing about a second instance, a pipe, or a socket.
   It supplies only an edge-queue interface: ir_pop_tx_edge, ir_push_rx_edge, and
   ir_get_clock_cycles. The layer above the core operates that interface.
   psemu_get_audio_samples uses the same shape. It lets a frontend pull PCM data out, and the core
   knows nothing about the audio library.

   This file does not model the 40kHz square wave inside the "on" interval of a pulse. No observable
   behavior depends on the sub-carrier. Only the gated on/off envelope is important.
   Thus IR_CARRIER_HZ has one use. It gives the BFLT debounce window below.
   BGEN does not gate an edge. That bit selects whether the hardware divides the on envelope into a
   40kHz burst. It does not control whether the LED comes on. This file relays only the envelope, thus
   BGEN has nothing to gate. Two real apps that both operate on real hardware use opposite values of
   BGEN. See tx_emit_active in ir.c for those two apps, and for the fault that an earlier gate caused.

   The BFLT debounce window is approximately 2 carrier periods. This is an inferred constant, not a
   confirmed hardware measurement. This project marks all other unconfirmed assumptions the same
   way. See docs/hardware-notes.md. */
