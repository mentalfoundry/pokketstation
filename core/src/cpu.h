/* Ring buffer of recent (pc, cpsr) pairs.
   arm7tdmi_step records one entry at each step, for all callers.
   psemu_write_crash_report (psemu.c and psemu.h) uses this buffer to
   show the events before a fault. A frontend needs no trace function of
   its own for this. See docs/hardware-notes.md for the crash
   investigation that caused this project to add the buffer.
   The buffer first held 256 entries. A real crash report showed a long
   straight-line drift through memory that is not code. This drift
   filled the full 256-entry window and erased the history of the bad
   jump that caused the drift. This project increased the size to 8192
   entries (64KB for each instance) to correct that. */

       live data. See arm_set_mode, which exchanges the two sets at FIQ entry and at FIQ exit.

       This bank is the reason that a real FIQ handler can use r8-r12 as scratch registers without a
       save. It is also why a "fast interrupt" is fast. This emulator banked only r13 and r14 for a
       long time. Thus a FIQ handler destroyed r8-r12 of the interrupted code and gave no error. One

   code. A static disassembly that does not track the mode cannot follow

   psemu_trace target (see PSEMU_TRACE_HOOKS in core/CMakeLists.txt),
   thus frontends have no cost.
   The trace ring above answers the question "which steps occurred before
   this point" for the last PSEMU_TRACE_SIZE steps. This callback answers
   a different question: does execution get to a given address at any
   time during a full run? A ring buffer cannot answer that question,
   because a run of sufficient length writes over the ring many times.
   The watch list in tools/ir_probe.c uses this callback to make a
