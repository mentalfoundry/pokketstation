/* The PocketStation IOP power-control register.
   One bitmask, IOP_DATA, receives writes through two complementary write-only ports.
   IOP_STOP (+0x4) ORs bits into the mask. IOP_START (+0x8) ANDs bits out of the mask.
   A set bit means that the subsystem is stopped.

   The description of bit 5 is "Sound Enable (START=On, STOP=Off)".
   Audio needs this bit set and DAC_CTRL bit 0 set (see dac.h).
   This emulator does not model the other bits (LED and IR), because they have no effect on emulated
   behavior.
   Software reads the bitmask back through IOP_STAT, which has the same address as IOP_STOP (+0x4).

   Each byte writes directly into `data` at its own bit position: an OR for STOP, and an AND-NOT for
   START. This emulator does not collect writes in a scratch register and apply them only after a
   full 32-bit store.

   History: an earlier version of this file did use that collect-and-apply method. This was a
   confirmed fault. A direct trace of the BIOS and the apps (see docs/hardware-notes.md) showed that
   real code writes these registers with single-byte stores. Single-byte stores never got to the
   word-complete gate, thus this emulator discarded them and gave no error.
   To apply each byte immediately gives the same result as collect-and-apply for a full 32-bit store.
   OR and AND-NOT are per-bit operations, thus the order of the bytes has no effect. The
   delayed-apply step was not necessary. */
