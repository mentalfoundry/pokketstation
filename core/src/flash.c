     a middle frame, 0x53 for the last frame, and 0xA0 for a free frame).
   - bytes 4-7: the total file size, little-endian. This value is valid
     only in the first frame of a file.
   - bytes 8-9: the link to the next block, little-endian. The value is
     0-based among the 15 data blocks. Add 1 to get the physical block
     number. The value 0xFFFF is the end of the chain.

/* A confirmed requirement. A byte-by-byte bisection of a real card dump
   isolated it. The menu-browsing code of the BIOS requires byte 6 of the
   file-name field (frame offset 0x10) to be the ASCII character 'P'.
   This code is separate from the app-selection and dispatch routine
   above, and it executes before that routine. It lets a user move to an
   entry and select it.

   Two real directory entries confirm the pattern. A usual PS1 save ID
   has a mandatory hyphen in its region code, for example "SLUS-00892".
   When the save also contains a PocketStation app, a 'P' replaces that
   hyphen: "BASLUSP00892..." and "BISLPMP86247...". The product-code
   prefix `SLPM` of the second example already contains a different 'P'.
   Because of this, the isolation of the real marker byte needed two
   rounds of bisection.

   Confirmed by test: a real card that operates correctly continues to
   dispatch when each other byte of the file name is incorrect or zero,
   if this one byte is 'P'. The card stops dispatch if this byte changes,
   even with a realistic name in the field. For an arbitrary loaded app
   there is no real product code to write here, thus this code leaves the
   remainder of the field empty. Only this one flag byte is necessary. */
