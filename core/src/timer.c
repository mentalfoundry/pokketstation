           History: an earlier version of this function decreased count by the raw cycles directly,

           it gets to zero. Thus zero is a state of the counter.

           A direct measurement on real hardware confirms this. See screen 6 of pk_timing_bench, with
           the results in pk_timing_bench/VERIFICATION.md.
           Timer2 at period 1016 over 256 reloads, and at period 2032 over 128 reloads, both gave
           exactly 1 tick for each reload more than a period of P ticks predicts.
           The extra time is the same absolute value at both periods. This removes a rate error and a
           divisor error as causes, and gives a fixed error of one tick for each period.

           This code used exactly `count` ticks for each reload before. Thus each timer expired one
           tick early. */
