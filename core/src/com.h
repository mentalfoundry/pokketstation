/* The PocketStation communication port. This block is the link to a PS1. The link goes through the
   memory card connector. A PocketStation is a memory card in that connector. This block carries the
   bytes of that connection.

   Register layout, at 0x0C000000:

   | Offset | Register  | Contents |
   |---|---|---|
   | +0x00 | COM_MODE  | bit0 Data Output Enable. bit1 /ACK Output Level (1 = drive LOW). bit2 unknown. |
   | +0x04 | COM_STAT1 | bit1 Error flag (0 = Okay, 1 = Error). The other bits are unknown. |
   | +0x08 | COM_DATA  | bits 0 to 7. A read gets the byte from the PS1. A write sends a byte to the PS1. |
   | +0x10 | COM_CTRL1 | bit0 and bit1 unknown. The observed values are 0, 2, and 3. |
   | +0x14 | COM_STAT2 | bit0 Ready (0 = Busy, 1 = Ready). The hardware sets the bit after 8 bits. |
   | +0x18 | COM_CTRL2 | bit0 and bit1 unknown. The observed values are 1 and 3. |

   A published register map is the source of this layout. That map is community reverse engineering.
   It is not a manufacturer specification. The map marks the function of the CTRL1 bits and the CTRL2
   bits as unknown. It gives only the values that it observed. This file uses the same order of trust
   as each other peripheral of this emulator. See docs/hardware-notes.md.

   THE PROTOCOL IS NOT IN THIS FILE. The kernel of the real BIOS holds the protocol. A COM interrupt
   is FIQ source bit 6 (INT_COM, see intc.h). The FIQ handler of the kernel processes that source. It
   does this before it calls the FIQ callback of an app. That handler reads the incoming byte. It
   then selects a reply and writes the reply back. Thus this file models only the byte path and the
   handshake lines.

   The real firmware supplies each command. The memory card commands are 0x52 Read Sector, 0x53 Get
   ID, and 0x57 Write Sector. The PocketStation commands are 0x50, and 0x58 to 0x5F.

   This division is necessary. The commands 0x5B and 0x5C execute a function number. The numbers 0x80
   to 0xFF resolve through a function table in the header of the app file. Only the app supplies that
   code. Thus no protocol code outside the emulated machine can answer those commands.

   THE DOCKING SIGNAL IS SEPARATE FROM THIS BLOCK. INT_IOP (bit 11, see intc.h) is the docking sense.
   A value of 0 is undocked. A value of 1 is docked to a PS1. The IRQ handler of the kernel uses that
   one source for both directions of the transition. com_set_docked drives the signal. */

       THE OUTPUT IS ONE BYTE BEHIND THE INPUT. This block is a shift register. One exchange moves
       the byte of the console in. The same exchange moves the held byte out. Thus the console
       receives the byte of exchange N during exchange N+1. The kernel writes 0xFF into this register
       at initialization. That write gives the first exchange a byte to send.

       A trace of the kernel confirms this behavior. During the Get ID command, the kernel writes
       FLAG while it processes the 0x81 byte. It writes 0x5A while it processes the 0x53 byte. A
       published command table gives the reply to 0x81 as "N/A". It gives the reply to 0x53 as FLAG.
       Only a shift register agrees with both facts. See tools/com_probe.c. */

       COM_STAT1. That latch is COM_STAT1 bit 1.

       THE KERNEL NEEDS THIS SIGNAL TO END A COMMAND. After the last byte, the kernel waits at
       0x040007B8 in the J110 revision. It polls COM_STAT1 there. Nothing else releases that wait. A
       test against a real dump confirms bit 1, and it rejects each of bits 2 to 7. See
       tools/com_probe.c, the selbit mode.

       The published register map names bit 1 "Error flag". It gives one candidate meaning for the
       flag: "/SEL disabled during transfer". That candidate is the correct one. The release of /SEL
       is not a fault. It is the usual end of each command. */
