   It does not identify the data that the content holds at this time. A hash of the full
   file cannot give this identity, because an app save changes the full file.

   This difference became important when a frontend got the ability to write content to
   disk. A save state contains its own copy of flash. Thus, if you load a save state onto
   the wrong card, it replaces that full card, and all subsequent app writes go into the
   wrong file. The guard must continue to operate after an app saves. If it does not, it
   obstructs the user frequently, and a user then removes it. The guard is then absent for
   the condition that causes damage.

   The hash uses these bytes, for each content kind:
   - CARD: the allocation state of each directory frame, and the file name of each frame
     in use. This data shows which saves are on this card. An app that writes save data
     does not change this data.
   - MCS: the directory frame of the file (state and name), then the title-sector metadata
     of its body.
   - APP: only the title-sector metadata of the body.
   - UNKNOWN: the full buffer, because no better data is available.

   "Title-sector metadata" is all data up to the end of the standard PS1 icon. This
   includes the header, the Shift-JIS title, the CLUT, and the icon frames. All of this
   data must stay valid, or the BIOS cannot dispatch the app. Thus an app cannot use this
   data for save data. This data is also what a person means by the identity of an app. A
   test with a real app and a real save confirms this. In that test, an IR card trade
   changed bytes at save-data offsets 0x59 and 0x340, which are after this region.

   TWO CARDS THAT HOLD THE SAME FILES GIVE THE SAME HASH. No change can correct this: a
   real PS1 memory card has no serial number, thus there is no method to identify two
   identical cards. A frontend that must keep them separate must also use the file path.

   the full file. For a .mcs file, this is the file minus its first frame of 0x80 bytes.

   own blocks, because FLASH2 shows it the full synthesized card. A .mcs or .pss file has
   no space for those bytes, thus this function discards them. If an app needs more space

   override.

   For this setting, a write for each frame is NOT sufficient. This is why the setting

   sound initialization. The BIOS also clears RAM early in its boot sequence. Both of
   these events occur in the first emulated frame of the frontend, and the boot sound is

   THE PROTOCOL IS NOT HERE. The BIOS of the emulated machine holds the protocol. A byte from the

/* Sets the /SEL line of the connector. `selected` is 0 for released. A nonzero value holds the line.
   A PS1 holds this line for the full duration of one command. It releases the line between
   commands. On a PS1 emulator this line is the select bit of the controller port.

   A CALLER MUST RELEASE THIS LINE AFTER EACH COMMAND. The kernel waits for the release, and that
   wait is how it learns that a command ended. Without the release, the kernel answers the first
   command and then answers nothing. psemu_com_transfer holds the line for each byte that it sends,
   thus a caller only has to release it.

   The usual sequence for one command is a call to psemu_com_transfer for each byte, and then a call
   to psemu_com_set_selected(ps, 0). Run the machine for a short time after the release, so the
   kernel can leave its wait and make its command state ready again. */

/* Exchanges one byte with the PS1.
   `data_in` is the byte from the PS1. This function writes the reply of the device to
   *data_out.

   This function RUNS THE CPU. An interrupt handler on real hardware answers a byte. Thus the
   emulated machine must execute before the reply exists. This function executes a maximum of
   `timeout_cycles` cycles. It stops when the kernel drives the acknowledge line.

   It returns a nonzero value after the device acknowledges the byte. It returns 0 if the device does
   not answer inside the budget. A PS1 gives a missing acknowledge one of two meanings: the
   device is absent, or the command is complete. A caller gives a 0 return the same two meanings. The
   acknowledge of a memory card carries the same meaning.

   *data_out gets 0xFF if the device supplies no reply byte. An idle data line on this bus is high.

   PSEMU_COM_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CYCLES is a sufficient budget for `timeout_cycles` in the docked
   condition. A caller can supply a larger value.

   The `wait` mode of tools/com_probe.c measured the cost of one answer against a real J110 dump. The
   first byte of a command costs 177 reference cycles, because the kernel must take the FIQ. Each
   byte after the first byte costs 52 to 112 cycles, because the kernel already polls COM_STAT2
   inside that same FIQ. Thus 177 cycles is the worst measured answer.

   THIS COST SCALES WITH CLK_MODE. That measurement used CLK_MODE 7 (3,997,696Hz), and the kernel
   selects that mode when it enables communication in the docked condition. The budget here is in
   PSEMU_ASSUMED_CPU_HZ reference cycles (1,056,000Hz). Thus a slower clock makes the same work cost
   more reference cycles. The measured 177 cycles is approximately 670 CPU cycles. That work costs
   approximately 5600 reference cycles at CLK_MODE 2, and approximately 21600 at CLK_MODE 0.

   This value covers CLK_MODE 2 and each faster mode. It is approximately 46 times the worst measured
   answer at the docked clock. An app that slows the clock below CLK_MODE 2 while it is docked needs
   a larger budget from the caller.

   Do not make this value very large. A command gives no acknowledge for its last byte, because the
   command is complete at that point. Thus every command reaches this budget one time, and the
   machine executes for the full budget before this function returns. */

   - The ARM/Thumb decoder of this emulator has a gap.
   - Code before this point calculated a bad jump target, and the CPU now executes data

   If the fault occurs late in execution, a bad jump target is the more probable cause.
